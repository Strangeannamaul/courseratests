I'm starting off basic, and adding elements of the assignment as i go. </p></div></div>


 <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">Is this right?<div class=section><p>
So far, I believe I have created the 3 columns I am looking for, and hopefully the header is also behaving as I expect it too, above these three bordered
  sections of text. </p></div></div>


 <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">Is this right?<div class=section><p>
I have no idea why the colour isnt filling each of these sections but finally they are all in a row. i need the medium size to make this section fill the whole screen.
Also i still need three boxes in the top right corner of each of these sections. At least they're resposive to browser size. </p></div></div>
