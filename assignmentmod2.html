     <p>  I think I solved my confusion of this structure thing. Just kidding, this is still chaos.
    I am going to see what happens if I add a buttload of text to this section, so it fills up more space. Totally removed the subheaders,
      because I lost the 3 equal columns. Once I get that back, then I can revisit the subheaders to the top right sections. 
      How frustrating! Anyays this should be plenty of text.

   <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
         
         <p>This should be 3 sections, each with a coloured background, each with 3 subheaders to the right corner. I dont know why my header insists on remaining
          to the left, or why none of the styling for the fonts will apply. I really just want this assignment to work out. It should be so basic and simple
          but it just isn's working out!!! Reviewing all the lectures and going over things, changing it up constantly. I still need more text for this section
          because i want all three to have about equal content.

         <p> That means that there needs to be much more content in this section. Maybe if they all equal the same amount of space, they'll magically be in the same row.
          That would be something haha. Maybe it will even wrap down to the bottom in mid size. Honestly, this is so confusing. Please let this dumb section be 
          underneath and fill the whole space in medium view.</p>
