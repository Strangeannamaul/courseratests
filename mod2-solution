<h1> I'm writing my own content! </h1>
Basically, just starting this out from the most bare-bones structure and adding elements as I go to flesh out the full requirements on this assignment. It's like I took all this information in but now I'm having to go back to the beginning and put it all together. So, at least for a while, this is not going to be very pretty.
